# Form Builder
The Iron Yard Project: Form Builder

This project will test your knowledge of parsing through an array of data and appending it to the DOM.

### INSTRUCTIONS

- Download the starter files below and using the variable `formData` at the top of the `main.js` file to iterate through 
the data and dynamically add the form fields to the page.
- The basic HTML and starter files are included for you.

### HARD MODE

Use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) to add in the icons to the left of the inputs. You'll notice the `fa-` is in 
the data for each element.
